After the tragic loss of life in 1912 on the massive ship, many of the factors were placed in context in trying to understand what contributed to the survival or the demise of the individuals on board. With limited data on those who survived and those who perished. The data is ideal to help know whether some individuals who were on the ship survived or perished. With a section of labeled data with survival determined,  the test data which has no label for the of survival we can pinpoint whether specific individuals in the travelers list survived or perished.
